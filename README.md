# Codecrafters: Build your own interpreter: In Gleam

An interpreter written in the [Gleam language](https://gleam.run), by following the first half of the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by Robert Nystrom.

This was built for the ["Build your own interpreter" Codecrafters Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview) and interprets the [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) scripting language described in the book.
